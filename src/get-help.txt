> dink.exe [function] path

This utility is used to manage temp directory links. Generally directories used for caching, like .vs, .vscode, .git , bin, node_modules
all of which cand easily be recreated through cli commands, like devenv, dotnet build or npm init. Basically all this 
files will be moved to the temporary directoy of this system.

This executable governs a file at the root of the directory named "mount-temp.user.ps1" to input new required directory 
entries and more. The random temp directory name will be stored there for further crereation. You, user, is free to append to that file
after the user initialization mark.

usage guide:

dink init   at the root of your project's root directory in order to generate the configuration file. It's 
           also recommended to add the configuration file name cited before to your global .gitignore setup, since this is 
           a context-based user-reliant concept it should not be pushed publicly.

# After initialization you can #

dink ad %path   to create a directory junction within the desired path (pointing to a temp-located folder)
dink rm %path   to remove both symlinc and the temp folder (also removes from the recreation instructions set )
dink set        to recreate the temporary folder structure needed to work on the project

# Warn! your "mount-temp.user.ps1" file should't be more than 6 directories up your current folder.
